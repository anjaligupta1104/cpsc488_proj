# How to get MaxSkew and MinSkew for CLIP with Human Preference Classifier
Please download pretrained human preference classifier from the [official repo](https://github.com/tgxs002/align_sd) for "Better Aligning Text-to-Image Models with Human Preference" project. After downloading the model, create a folder called "Human_Preference_Classifier_model" inside "MaxSkew_MinSkew_Evaluation" folder and put the pretrained model in it.
